1.write floyd
2.add a boolean vector to track if a grid in the matrix is occupied by some
node
3.modify `addpt' so that it will sweep all elements in the matrix and update
the distance accordingly(now only handles the 4*block_num,need to update later
added nodes manually)

PROBLEM:

SOLVED:
<Mon Feb  9 11:14:32 HKT 2009>
why the node has point type of `int' but not `double'

changed to UINT = unsigned long now.

IMPROVEMENT:
1.note that when determining the intersection
2.can sort the list first, and use binary search to see if the segment's two end
will locate in the same position:
i.e. ... i (p1 p2) i+1 ...
